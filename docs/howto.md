query: axios get then example

Phind
To make a GET request using Axios and handle the response using the .then() method, you can follow the examples below:

Example 1: Basic GET request and error handling

const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
In this example, we make a GET request to https://api.example.com/data. If the request is successful, the response data is logged to the console. If an error occurs, it is caught and logged to the console as well.

Example 2: Error handling and accessing response details

const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    if (error.response) {
      console.error(error.response.data);
      console.error(error.response.status);
      console.error(error.response.headers);
    } else if (error.request) {
      console.error(error.request);
    } else {
      console.error("Error", error.message);
    }
  });
In this example, we handle errors based on their types. If the error occurred on the server side, the error object will have a response property that contains the error's status, headers, and other details. If the request was made but no response was received, the error object will have a request property.

Example 3: Using async/await

const axios = require('axios');

async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

getData();
In this example, we use the async/await syntax to make the GET request. The await keyword is used to wait for the promise returned by axios.get() to resolve or reject. If the request is successful, the response data is logged to the console. If an error occurs, it is caught and logged to the console.

These examples demonstrate different ways to make a GET request using Axios and handle the response using the .then() method or async/await syntax. You can choose the approach that best suits your needs. Remember to handle errors appropriately to ensure robust error handling in your application.

vue js get row index of current field

PhindSEARCH
query: Vue.js get row index of current field

Phind
To get the row index of the current field in Vue.js, you can use the v-for directive to iterate over the rows in your template and then access the index using the special variable $index. Here's an example:

<template>
  <div>
    <table>
      <tr v-for="(row, index) in rows" :key="index">
        <td>{{ row.name }}</td>
        <td>{{ getIndex(index) }}</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      rows: [
        { name: 'John' },
        { name: 'Jane' },
        { name: 'Bob' }
      ]
    };
  },
  methods: {
    getIndex(index) {
      return index;
    }
  }
};
</script>
In this example, we have a table with rows that are rendered using v-for. The getIndex method is called for each row, passing in the current index. The method simply returns the index, which is then displayed in the second column of each row.

By accessing $index within the v-for loop, you can directly access the row index without needing to define a separate method.

@keyup can't track the change if input number increased by scrolle

PhindSEARCH
query: Vue.js @keyup not tracking input number change with scroll

Phind
To track changes in an input number when it is increased by scrolling, you can use a combination of the @input and @wheel event listeners in Vue.js. Here's an example:

<template>
  <div>
    <input type="number" v-model="number" @input="handleChange" @wheel="handleScroll" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      number: 0
    };
  },
  methods: {
    handleChange() {
      // Handle input change
      console.log('Input changed:', this.number);
    },
    handleScroll(event) {
      // Handle scroll event
      const delta = Math.sign(event.deltaY);
      this.number += delta;
      console.log('Number scrolled:', this.number);
    }
  }
};
</script>
In this example, we have an input field of type "number" bound to the number data property using v-model. The @input event listener is used to track any changes in the input field, while the @wheel event listener is used to handle scroll events.

The handleChange method is called whenever the input value changes, and it logs the updated value of this.number to the console.

The handleScroll method is called when the user scrolls within the input field. It calculates the scroll direction using the event.deltaY property and updates the value of this.number accordingly. The updated value is then logged to the console.

By combining these event listeners, you can track changes in the input number both when it is manually edited and when it is increased by scrolling.

call in a method axios another method in vue js methods

Phind
To call an Axios method within another method in Vue.js, you can import the Axios library and use it to make the HTTP request. Here's an example:

<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="getData">Get Data</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
  methods: {
    getData() {
      axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
          this.processData(response.data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.error(error);
        });
    },
    processData(data) {
      // Process the data here
      console.log('Data:', data);
    }
  }
};
</script>
In this example, we import the Axios library using import axios from 'axios'. Then, within the getData method, we use axios.get to make a GET request to https://api.example.com/data. When the response is received, the processData method is called and passed the response data.

The processData method can then handle the data as needed. In this example, we simply log the data to the console.

By separating the Axios call into its own method (getData) and calling another method (processData) within the .then() callback, you can easily handle the response data in a separate method.

Remember to handle errors appropriately using .catch() to ensure proper error handling in your application.

sync vue js attributes with the change of form input value

Phind
To sync Vue.js attributes with the change of a form input value, you can use the v-model directive. The v-model directive provides two-way data binding between the input value and a data property in your Vue component. Here's an example:

<template>
  <div>
    <input type="text" v-model="inputValue" />
    <p>Input Value: {{ inputValue }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      inputValue: ''
    };
  }
};
</script>
In this example, we have an input field of type "text" bound to the inputValue data property using v-model. Whenever the user types or modifies the input value, the inputValue property will be automatically updated. Similarly, if you update the inputValue property programmatically, the input field will reflect the updated value.

You can access and use the inputValue property in other methods or computed properties within your Vue component. Any changes to the inputValue property will be reflected in the input field, and any changes made in the input field will update the inputValue property.

By using v-model, you can easily keep your Vue component attributes in sync with the value of the form input.

colspan is not working on th of table tfoot

PhindSEARCH
query: colspan not working on th of table tfoot in Vue.js

Phind
To use colspan in the <th> element of the <tfoot> section in Vue.js, you need to ensure that the table structure is correct and that the <th> elements have the correct attributes set. Here are a few things to check:

Make sure the table structure is correct:
The <tfoot> section should come after the <tbody> section and before the <thead> section.
The <tfoot> section should contain the footer rows with <tr> elements.
Each footer row should have <th> elements as table headers.
Set the colspan attribute correctly:
The colspan attribute specifies the number of columns a cell should span.
Add the colspan attribute to the <th> element in the <tfoot> section and set it to the desired number of columns to span.
Here's an example of using colspan in the <th> element of the <tfoot> section in Vue.js:

<table>
  <thead>
    <!-- table header rows -->
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <!-- table body rows -->
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="3">Footer Cell 1</th>
      <th colspan="2">Footer Cell 2</th>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
In this example, the first <th> in the footer row will span 3 columns, and the second <th> will span 2 columns.

Remember to adjust the colspan values to match the number of columns you want the cells to span.

how to append tr in tbody by vus js in laravel

Phind
To append a <tr> element to the <tbody> using Vue.js in Laravel, you can utilize Vue's reactivity system to update the data property that represents the rows in the table. Here's an example:

<template>
  <div>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr v-for="row in rows" :key="row.id">
          <td>{{ row.name }}</td>
          <td>{{ row.age }}</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <button @click="addRow">Add Row</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      rows: [
        { id: 1, name: 'John', age: 25 },
        { id: 2, name: 'Jane', age: 30 },
      ]
    };
  },
  methods: {
    addRow() {
      const newRow = { id: 3, name: 'Bob', age: 35 };
      this.rows.push(newRow);
    }
  }
};
</script>
In this example, we have a table with a <tbody> section that contains rows rendered using v-for based on the rows data property. Each row has a unique id and displays the name and age properties.

The addRow method is called when the "Add Row" button is clicked. It creates a new row object (newRow) and pushes it to the rows array using this.rows.push(newRow). This triggers Vue's reactivity system, causing the table to update and display the new row.

When you click the "Add Row" button, a new row with the specified data will be appended to the table.

Make sure to adjust the data structure and properties according to your specific needs.

get parent element from event passing in vue js

Phind
To get the parent element from an event in Vue.js, you can access the event.target property and use the parentNode property to traverse up the DOM tree. Here's an example:

<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="handleClick">Click me</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    handleClick(event) {
      const parentElement = event.target.parentNode;
      console.log('Parent element:', parentElement);
    }
  }
};
</script>
In this example, we have a button with a click event listener (@click) that triggers the handleClick method. The event object is automatically passed to the method.

Inside the handleClick method, we access the event.target property to get the element that triggered the event (in this case, the button). We then use the parentNode property to access the parent element of the button.

The parentElement variable will contain the parent element of the button. You can perform further operations or access properties of the parent element as needed.

By using event.target.parentNode, you can easily get the parent element from an event in Vue.js.

get parent and others element by event in vue js

Phind
To access various elements related to an event in Vue.js, you can use the event.target property along with other DOM traversal methods and properties. Here's an example that demonstrates how to get the parent element, as well as other elements, based on an event:

<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="handleClick">Click me</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    handleClick(event) {
      const targetElement = event.target;
      const parentElement = targetElement.parentNode;
      const siblingElement = targetElement.nextElementSibling;
      const previousSiblingElement = targetElement.previousElementSibling;

      console.log('Target element:', targetElement);
      console.log('Parent element:', parentElement);
      console.log('Sibling element:', siblingElement);
      console.log('Previous sibling element:', previousSiblingElement);
    }
  }
};
</script>
In this example, we have a button with a click event listener (@click) that triggers the handleClick method. The event object is automatically passed to the method.

Inside the handleClick method, we access the event.target property to get the element that triggered the event (in this case, the button). We then use various DOM traversal methods and properties to access other related elements:

parentNode: Accesses the parent element of the target element.
nextElementSibling: Accesses the next sibling element of the target element.
previousElementSibling: Accesses the previous sibling element of the target element.
The example logs the target element, parent element, sibling element, and previous sibling element to the console. You can perform further operations or access properties of these elements as needed.

By using the event.target property along with DOM traversal methods and properties, you can access various elements related to an event in Vue.js.

event.find not found in vue js

PhindSEARCH
query: event find method in Vue.js

Phind
In Vue.js, there is no built-in find method available directly on the event object. However, you can use other methods and techniques to achieve similar functionality. Here are a couple of approaches you can take to find elements related to an event in Vue.js:

Querying the DOM:
Use DOM methods like querySelector or querySelectorAll to find elements based on selectors.
Access the elements using the event target's parent or other relevant elements.
Here's an example:
   <template>
     <div>
       <ul @click="handleClick">
         <li>Item 1</li>
         <li>Item 2</li>
         <li>Item 3</li>
       </ul>
     </div>
   </template>

   <script>
   export default {
     methods: {
       handleClick(event) {
         const listItem = event.target.closest('li');
         console.log('List item:', listItem);
       }
     }
   };
   </script>
In this example, when a <li> element inside the <ul> is clicked, the handleClick method is triggered. The event.target property gives you access to the clicked element. The closest method is used to find the closest <li> ancestor element of the clicked element.

Utilizing Vue.js data and methods:
If you have dynamic data and want to find elements based on specific criteria, you can use Vue.js data and methods to filter and find the desired elements.
Update the data properties or invoke methods based on the event to determine the elements you want to target.
Here's an example:
   <template>
     <div>
       <ul>
         <li v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">
           {{ item.name }}
         </li>
       </ul>
     </div>
   </template>

   <script>
   export default {
     data() {
       return {
         items: [
           { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
           { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
           { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' }
         ]
       };
     },
     methods: {
       handleClick(event) {
         const itemId = parseInt(event.target.dataset.itemId);
         const item = this.items.find(item => item.id === itemId);
         console.log('Clicked item:', item);
       }
     }
   };
   </script>
In this example, the <li> elements are rendered using v-for based on the items data property. Each <li> element has a data-item-id attribute that corresponds to the id of the item. When an <li> element is clicked, the handleClick method is triggered. The event.target.dataset.itemId is used to access the value of the data-item-id attribute of the clicked element. Then, the find method is used on the items array to locate the item with the matching id.

Remember that these are just examples, and you can adapt them to your specific use case. The approach you choose depends on your requirements and the structure of your Vue.js components.

jq find tbody eq 1 example

Phind
To find the second <tbody> element using jQuery, you can use the eq() method along with the find() method. Here's an example:

$(document).ready(function() {
  const secondTbody = $('tbody').eq(1);
  console.log('Second tbody:', secondTbody);
});
In this example, the $(document).ready() function ensures that the code is executed when the DOM is fully loaded.

The $('tbody') selector selects all <tbody> elements on the page. The eq(1) method is used to filter the selection and retrieve the second <tbody> element (index 1). Note that the index is zero-based, so eq(1) corresponds to the second element.

The secondTbody variable will contain the jQuery object representing the second <tbody> element. You can perform further operations or access properties of this element as needed.

Make sure to include the jQuery library in your project for this code to work.

jq append row but keeping original tr

Phind
To append a new row while keeping the original <tr> elements using jQuery, you can use the clone() method to create a copy of the original row and then append it to the desired location. Here's an example:

$(document).ready(function() {
  const originalRow = $('table tr:first');
  const newRow = originalRow.clone();
  $('table').append(newRow);
});
In this example, the $(document).ready() function ensures that the code is executed when the DOM is fully loaded.

The originalRow variable selects the first <tr> element within the <table>. The clone() method creates a copy of the original row.

The newRow variable holds the cloned row.

Finally, the newRow is appended to the <table> using the append() method. This adds the new row while keeping the original rows intact.

Make sure to adjust the selector $('table tr:first') to match your specific table structure.

while cloning by jq dropdown not selected in appended table

Phind
If you're cloning a row that contains a dropdown/select element and the selected value is not being preserved in the cloned row, you can manually set the selected value after cloning. Here's an example:

$(document).ready(function() {
  const originalRow = $('table tr:first');
  const newRow = originalRow.clone();

  // Find the dropdown/select element in the cloned row
  const dropdown = newRow.find('select');

  // Get the selected value from the original dropdown
  const selectedValue = originalRow.find('select').val();

  // Set the selected value in the cloned dropdown
  dropdown.val(selectedValue);

  $('table').append(newRow);
});
In this example, after cloning the original row, we find the dropdown/select element within the cloned row using newRow.find('select'). Then, we retrieve the selected value from the original dropdown using originalRow.find('select').val(). Finally, we set the selected value in the cloned dropdown using dropdown.val(selectedValue).

By explicitly setting the selected value in the cloned dropdown, you can ensure that the selected option is preserved in the appended table row.

Make sure to adjust the selectors $('table tr:first') and newRow.find('select') to match your specific table structure and dropdown element.

It seems like you're having an issue with a dropdown selection when appending a table row using jQuery. This problem could be caused by a few different factors, and I'll provide some general troubleshooting steps to help you diagnose and potentially resolve the issue.

Check the HTML structure:
Ensure that the dropdown element you want to clone and append is correctly structured within the table row. Make sure that the dropdown has a unique identifier or class that you can target in your jQuery code.

Select the correct dropdown element:
When cloning and appending a table row, use jQuery to select the dropdown element correctly. You can use selectors like .find(), .children(), or .closest() to target the specific dropdown within the cloned row.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
var newRow = oldRow.clone();
var dropdown = newRow.find('.dropdown-selector');
// Modify dropdown or perform any other necessary actions
Check for event handlers and data binding:
If you're using event handlers or data binding on the dropdown, make sure that these are applied correctly to the cloned dropdown element. You may need to reinitialize or rebind any events or data when cloning a row.

Ensure uniqueness of HTML IDs:
If you are using IDs to identify elements within your page, make sure that the cloned elements have unique IDs. Duplicate IDs can cause issues.

Debug your JavaScript code:
Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the elements and check for any JavaScript errors in the console. This will help you identify issues with your code and pinpoint where the problem is occurring.

Check for any CSS issues:
CSS styles can sometimes interfere with the functionality of dropdowns, so make sure that your CSS rules are not affecting the cloned dropdown in an unexpected way.

Verify the order of operations:
Ensure that you are cloning and modifying the dropdown after it has been appended to the table. Sometimes, the order in which you perform these operations can affect the result.

If you can provide more specific information about your code and the problem you're facing, I can offer more targeted assistance. Sharing the relevant HTML and jQuery code will be helpful in diagnosing the issue.
